```

## Usage:
Select mode:
- 1: Sequential (Question 1 to 170)
- 2: Random (All question but shuffled)
- 3: 30 Questions Test (Random 30 questions)
- 4: Select where you want to start (if you want to split questions for different days)
- 5: Train 30 Questions with Most Wrong Answers

Question will guide you how to answer:
### Type 1:
```md
[?] 1. Convolutional Neural Network can be trained mainly as a supervised learning.: 
 > [X] a) Áno
   [ ] b) Nie
```
To get point you have to answer with right arrow on the correct option.

### Type 2:
```md
[?] 2. Among the following, which one are hyperparameters: 
   [X] a) number of layers in the neural network
   [X] b) learning rate α (alpha)
   [X] c) size(s) of hidden layers
 > [X] d) number of iterations
```
To get point you have to answer with right arrow on the all correct options.

### Type 3:
```md
